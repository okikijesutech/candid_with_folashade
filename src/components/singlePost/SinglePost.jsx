          My oh my, it's good to finally be here. There were a million different ways to introduce myself or even things to talk about 
          to kickstart this website but I had to stick to keeping it simple, short and sweet….. like me, you know what i am saying;-). 
          Anywho, welcome to Candid with Folasade, where it's all about growth, lifestyle and personal development. I have a voice and 
          i wanted to use it. I have experiences and i wanted to share them. I have skills and i wanted to show them.
          That is all my personal site is about. 

          There is so much that went into getting this ready, physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, but it's something that i 
          have always wanted and i got it. I made the decision to finally have a site in 2021 but it's been one thing or the other since 
          then. But then again dreams do come true. 

          They say when you are surrounded by good people, it makes your life easier. It is true. I have some of the best people in the 
          world in my corner and they are part of the reason i am here today. From the ones that hear me talk about my dreams over and 
          over again like a broken record to the ones that get my lazy ass moving (pardon my french), it's just great that i don't have 
          to shoulder it all by myself. They were with me through the process and helped me get here. Shout out to Okiki, he has been 
          a darling.

          There is so much i want to say, so much i want to share, but i have to take it one step at a time. The thing with me is that i 
          always have a lot much to say, to my benefit and disadvantage as well. 

          So a quick rundown of my person for those who know and those who don't?..... Well…….

          I am a person who has a positive and optimistic outlook on life. I love to read, watch movies, write, listen to music,
          dance and play games. I am particular about the simple things of life, like the sound of rain on the roof, or the feel 
          of the cold in the morning. I enjoy telling stories, and there are so many to tell about me, and everything that goes on 
          around me. I share experiences through the art of storytelling and creative liberalism, that's the reason why i am 'The Raconteur'.  
          I love lifestyle, growth and personal development, and i have a podcast that is all about that. 

          I am a homebody and i love to stay in dark rooms. The idea of a good time to me is a day at home watching movies, anime, 
          or reading a novel.

          I speak two languages and i am on the pathway to a third (Japanese). こんにちわ

          I love nature, people, and i love to laugh. I am a dreamer, and I'm intentional about designing, creating and chasing said dreams.
          So i want you to take my hand and come see the world through my eyes.

          We are going to have a swell time together, cross my heart but not the other part. 

          Feel free to stop and smell the flower, check out other posts that pique your interest or tickle your fancy.
